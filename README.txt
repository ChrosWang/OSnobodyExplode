This game is made based on the idea of Keep talking and nobody explodes where two players cooperate to deactivate a bomb. I used the IPC message passing to create a server and a controller for the player. This gives me two benefits: 1. Each command is processed in order of a queue and 2. the timer could keep going while the game is running. 

For the game, I made a completely random game so each time is a new bomb to be deactivated. Because of that, I have to write algorithms to calculate the password for each bomb since each time is different. That was the most time-consuming part of the coding however it was fun. If I have more time, I would love to add more modules to add more fun to this game. 

I really hope you enjor this game! Have fun and don't explode!
